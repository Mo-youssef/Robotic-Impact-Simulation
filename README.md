# Robotic-Impact-Simulation
This is the notebooks used in 'Modeling Impact Robotics' paper to simulate the effect of using robots in a geriatric unit. 

# How to use
The ipython notebooks were developed and run on google colab so you don't have to worry about dependencies or any installations. Although regular backup for the results is recommended since all data is lost when colab runtime terminates. <br>
`run_simulation.ipynb` contain the main script to run the simulations under different setups. You can then save the simulation for further analysis <br>
`Visualizations.ipynb` contain the different scripts used to generate the visualizations in the paper.
